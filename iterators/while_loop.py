With bold black stripes over a fiery orange coat, each tigerâ€™s pattern is as unique as a fingerprint. Native to Asia, they thrive in diverse habitatsâ€”from dense jungles to snowy forests. Tigers are solitary hunters, relying on stealth and strength to ambush prey like deer and wild boar. Sadly, their numbers have dwindled due to habitat loss and poaching, making conservation efforts critical. Despite their fierce reputation, tigers play a vital role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems, symbolizing both beauty and strength in the wild."
